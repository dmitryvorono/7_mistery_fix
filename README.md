# Quadratic Equations Solver

This project solve quadratic equations

# How to Use

This project may be import in interactive python shell and it may be launch like this:

from quadratic_equation import get_roots
get_roots(a,b,c)
where a, b, c - the equation coefficients

# How to Launch Tests

```bash
python tests.py
```

# Project Goals
